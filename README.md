    <p>
      I am an Associate Professor (with tenure) in the Department of Political Science and Legal Studies 
      at Suffolk University in Boston. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Government at Harvard 
      University and my B.S. from the Department of Economic and Business Sciences at the University of Barcelona. 
      My curriculum vitae is 
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/s0k903ernvchi35fu6re2/Llaudet_CV_website.pdf?rlkey=fb02jzo91dc490pvdmowrgpcm&amp;dl=0" 
         target="_blank" style="color: #ff0000;">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      My interests are political methodology, elections, and education. I am particularly interested in questions 
      that involve estimating causal effects, such as 
      <em>What are the effects of political TV ads on voter turnout? Do negative political TV ads have the same 
      effects as positive political TV ads? What is the effect of incumbency status on electoral outcomes? What 
      are the mechanisms by which incumbents garner their advantage?</em>, 
      <em>What is the effect of a particular type of student collaboration on academic performance?</em>, and 
      <em>What is the effect of attending a private school on educational outcomes?</em>
    </p>

    <p>
      My research has been published in <em>Legislative Studies Quarterly</em>, <em>Electoral Studies</em>, 
      <em>Political Research Quarterly</em>, and <em>PS: Political Science &amp; Politics</em>. My most recent 
      publication is an introductory quantitative-methods textbook co-authored with Kosuke Imai, 
      <a href="https://bit.ly/dss_book" target="_blank" style="color: #ff0000;">Data Analysis for Social Science: 
      A Friendly and Practical Introduction</a> (DSS), Princeton University Press, 2022. Assuming no prior knowledge 
      of statistics or coding and only minimal knowledge of math, the book teaches the fundamentals of survey research, 
      predictive models, and causal inference while analyzing data from published research with the free and popular 
      statistical program R.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since Fall 2016, I have taught an introductory undergraduate quantitative-methods course at Suffolk University, 
      <em>
        <a href="https://bit.ly/teaching_dss" target="_blank" style="color: #ff0000;">Data Analysis and Politics</a>
      </em> (POLS 201). In it, students learn, by doing, how to code in R, use statistics and real-world data to answer 
      substantive political questions such as 
      <em>What is the effect of Pfizer's vaccine on the probability of contracting COVID?</em>, and identify the 
      strengths and weaknesses of social scientific studies.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2022-23, I was honored to give the 
      <a href="https://suffolku.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=a223919e-8065-4998-94a0-af0801268d11&amp;fbclid=IwAR2q7bwnyCLB08dCuGT10V0iSrbpEPMR6p0-ejoYLYbElepiYo5kqDrc-GM" 
         target="_blank" style="color: #ff0000;">Convocation Speech</a> at Suffolk. 
      In 2021-22, I won Suffolk's 
      <a href="https://sites.suffolk.edu/ctse/events/symposium/innovative-teaching-award/" 
         target="_blank" style="color: #ff0000;">Innovative Teaching Award</a> 
      for the innovations I have implemented in 
      <em>Data Analysis and Politics</em>. 
      In 2020-21, I was one of three faculty members nominated by Suffolk's Student Government Association for the 
      Outstanding College of Arts and Sciences Faculty Member of the Year Award.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am affiliated with the Institute for Quantitative Social Science and the Center for American Political Studies 
      at Harvard University. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for 
      Justice at NYU School of Law and a visiting scholar at the Juan March Institute.
