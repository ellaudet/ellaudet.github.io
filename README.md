				I am an Associate Professor (with tenure) in the Department of Political Science and Legal Studies&nbsp;at Suffolk University in Boston. I received my Ph.D. from&nbsp;the Department of Government at Harvard University and my B.S. from the Department of Economic and Business Sciences at the University of Barcelona.&nbsp;My curriculum vitae is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/s0k903ernvchi35fu6re2/Llaudet_CV_website.pdf?rlkey=fb02jzo91dc490pvdmowrgpcm&amp;dl=0" target="_blank" title=""><span style="color:#ff0000">here</span></a>.

				My interests are political methodology, elections, and education. I am particularly interested in questions that involve estimating causal effects, such as&nbsp;<em>What are the effects of political TV ads on voter turnout? Do negative political TV ads have the same effects as positive political TV ads? What is the effect of incumbency status on electoral outcomes? What are the mechanisms by which incumbents garner their advantage?</em>&nbsp;<em>What is the effect of a particular type of student collaboration on academic performance?&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;What is the effect of attending a private school on educational outcomes?</em>

My most recent publication is an introductory quantitative-methods textbook co-authored with Kosuke Imai, <a href="https://bit.ly/dss_book" target="_blank" title=""><span style="color:#ff0000">Data Analysis for Social Science: A Friendly and Practical Introduction</span></a>&nbsp;(DSS), Princeton University Press,&nbsp;2022. Assuming no prior knowledge of statistics or coding and only minimal knowledge of math, the book teaches the fundamentals of survey research, predictive models, and causal inference&nbsp;while analyzing data from published research with the free and popular statistical program R.&nbsp;

				Since Fall 2016, I have taught an introductory undergraduate quantitative-methods course at Suffolk University,<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/teaching_dss" target="_blank" title=""><span style="color:#ff0000">Data Analysis and Politics</span></a>&nbsp;</em>(POLS 201).&nbsp;In it, students&nbsp;learn, by doing, how to code in R, use statistics and real-world data to answer substantive political questions such as <em>What is the effect of Pfizer's&nbsp;vaccine on the probability of contracting COVID?</em>, and&nbsp;identify the strengths and weaknesses of social scientific studies.&nbsp;
