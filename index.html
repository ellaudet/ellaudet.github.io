            I am an Associate Professor with tenure in the Department of Political Science and Legal Studies 
            at Suffolk University in Boston. I hold a Ph.D. in Government from Harvard University and a B.S. in 
            Economic and Business Sciences from the University of Barcelona. My curriculum vitae is 
            <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/s0k903ernvchi35fu6re2/Llaudet_CV_website.pdf?rlkey=fb02jzo91dc490pvdmowrgpcm&amp;dl=0">here</a>.

            My interests are political methodology, elections, and education.
            My research has been published in <em>Legislative Studies Quarterly</em>, <em>Electoral Studies</em>, 
            <em>Political Research Quarterly</em>, and <em>PS: Political Science & Politics</em>.
            My most recent publication, co-authored with Kosuke Imai, 
            is <em><a href="https://ellaudet.github.io/dss_book/">Data Analysis for Social Science: A Friendly and Practical Introduction</a></em> (DSS), published by Princeton University Press and
            now also available <a href="https://www.iwanami.co.jp/book/b656062.html">in Japanese</a>. This textbook provides an accessible introduction to survey research, 
            predictive models, and causal inference, using the free and widely-used statistical software R.
            It assumes no prior knowledge of statistics or coding, and requires only minimal knowledge of math, 
            making it ideal for complete beginners.
        </p>

        <p>
            I primarily teach <em>Data Analysis and Politics</em> (POLS 201), 
            an introductory quantitative-methods course I developed and for which I earned Suffolk's <a href="https://sites.suffolk.edu/ctse/events/symposium/innovative-teaching-award/">Innovative Teaching Award</a> in 2022. 
            Additional honors include delivering Suffolk's <a href="https://suffolku.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=a223919e-8065-4998-94a0-af0801268d11">Convocation Speech</a> that same year and being nominated by Suffolk's Student Government Association for the 
            Outstanding College of Arts and Sciences Faculty Member of the Year Award in 2021.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am affiliated with Harvard University's Institute for Quantitative Social Science and the Center for American 
            Political Studies. Previously, I was as a postdoctoral fellow in the Democracy Program at NYU School of Law's 
            Brennan Center for Justice and as a visiting scholar at the Juan March Institute.
