            I am an Associate Professor (with tenure) in the Department of Political Science and Legal Studies 
            at Suffolk University in Boston. I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Government at Harvard 
            University and my B.S. from the Department of Economic and Business Sciences at the University of Barcelona. 
            My curriculum vitae is

            My interests are political methodology, elections, and education. I am particularly interested in questions 
            that involve estimating causal effects, such as 
            <em>What are the effects of political TV ads on voter turnout? Do negative political TV ads have the same 
            effects as positive political TV ads? What is the effect of incumbency status on electoral outcomes? What 
            are the mechanisms by which incumbents garner their advantage?</em>, 
            <em>What is the effect of a particular type of student collaboration on academic performance?</em>, and 
            <em>What is the effect of attending a private school on educational outcomes?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            My research has been published in <em>Legislative Studies Quarterly</em>, <em>Electoral Studies</em>, 
            <em>Political Research Quarterly</em>, and <em>PS: Political Science &amp; Politics</em>. My most recent 
            publication is an introductory quantitative-methods textbook co-authored with Kosuke Imai, 
            <a href="https://bit.ly/dss_book" target="_blank" style="color: #ff0000;">Data Analysis for Social Science:
